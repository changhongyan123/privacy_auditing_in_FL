# Efficient Privacy Auditing in Federated Learning (USENIX Security 2024)

This repository contains the official code for the paper **"Efficient Privacy Auditing in Federated Learning"**, published at the **33rd USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2024)**. The code consists of two main parts:
1. **Run Federated Learning (FL) tasks**  
2. **Audit the privacy risks of the trained FL models**

We leverage the **FedML framework** (a PyTorch-based federated learning library) to facilitate the FL process. Our implementation includes modifications to the FedML codebase to save intermediate training information for auditing purpose.

## üìÅ Code Structure

The repository includes the following key scripts:

| Script Name        | Description                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **1_create_split.py** | Prepares the federated learning data splits.        |
| **2_run_fl.py**      | Executes the federated learning training process.   |
| **3_run_audit.py**   | Audits the privacy risks of the trained model.      |

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Code

To run the complete process (data preparation, federated learning, and privacy auditing), execute the provided bash script (which trains resnet56 model on CIFAR-10).

```bash
bash run.sh
```
For different models and dataset combinations, please refer to the Table 1 in the paper.

## üöÄ Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
